### Description
Shred.io is designed to help skateboarders around the world find skate spots. Our app is community based, users both share and browse spots. This builds the community of the skateboard industry and allows users to find spots that are less popular than the widely publicized skate parks and Thrasher Magazine cover shots. When a user posts a spot to our database, a picture is stored along with it. When a user finds a spot they are interested in, he/she can get directions straight to the location, and leave a rating when they leave to better inform others. Ultimately our app is to make skateboarding less about finding spots and more about shredding.
### Instructions
When the app opens for the first time, you will be send to a login screen. Tap on the "Create Account" link.

Fill out the new account form, and when you login for the first time you will be sent to the Maps view of local spots. This functions just like a Google map, so you can zoom, drag, etc. Different spots will be shown as markers on the map, which you can click on to learn more information.

If you would rather view the spots in a list view, you can simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen. Similar to the maps view, clicking on any one of these items will allow you to learn more about the spot.

After browsing to a specific spot, you can read the description posted by the owner, view the picture, and leave a rating. 

To create a spot, click the red button in the lower right corner of the maps view. This will prompt you for information about the spot such as a description, picture, etc.


As a user you have the ability to rate spots, this is an important feature for curating content.

If you have any issues, please feel free to file an issue right here through Github!
